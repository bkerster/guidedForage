Follow up experiment to Kerster, Kello, & Rhodes, 2016

Places additional constraints on the participants to match the benefits of the model in the previous paper (perfect memory, and a grid to prevent overlapping movements).
The results from this study were accepted as a talk at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, and the paper will be available in the proceedings.

All files necessary to run the experiment are here, and should be fairly well documented in the source. 
Two jupyter notebooks are also incuded which were used to perform all reported analyses.
